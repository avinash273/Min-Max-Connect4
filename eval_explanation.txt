Explanation of Eval function of my code:

My eval function computes the utility value based on the depth provided as input. It takes these steps.

1. Taking the game state, my functions assigns weight to each grouping based on how close its to build a continous 4.
2. In horizontal, vertical or diagonal pattern if the there are 4 in row (1111) it assign a weight of 1
3. In horizontal, vertical or diagonal pattern if the there are 3 in row (111) it assign a weight of 0.60
4. In horizontal, vertical or diagonal pattern if the there are 2 in row (11) it assign a weight of 0.20
5. For three occurences (111) and an empty space diagonally it increases the value by 0.50
6. Eval function assigns a positive values and negative for the other player turn.
7. The eval function then takes the sum all the values and returns this based on which decision is made.

Sample:
In player1 turn, if player1 has 3 occurences of 1 horizontal and 3 occurences  of 1 diagonally.
And Player2 has 1 occurences of (11).

Then unitity is (0.60 + 0.50) - 0.20 = 0.90
